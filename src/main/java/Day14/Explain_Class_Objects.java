		//A class is collection of objects, methods, variables, fields, blocks, constructors
	
	
	//Object is instance[occurrence] of a Class
		//Object's dimensions can be defined within a statiscal validity
		//Object can act as a physical entity

		//What are the most important characteristics of an Object?
		
		//1. Identity - name
		//2. State/Attributes - color, breed, age, etc
		//3. Behavior - run, eat, sleep, bark, guard
